# SQL-Queries-Portfolio
Thanks to a database offered by Microsoft (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/samples/adventureworks-install-configure?view=sql-server-ver15&tabs=ssms) I wrote some queries with the intent to show my skills with Structured Query Language: particularly data cleaning.

Also, one of the queries will be useful in creating a Tableau dashboard regarding the internet sales. The dashboard can be seen here: https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/marco.longo/viz/Wip2/AdventureWorks
